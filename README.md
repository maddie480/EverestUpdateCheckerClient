# Update Checker

This code mod for Celeste adds an option to your Mod Options menu to check for mod updates. It will show you which mods are outdated, and allow you to update them in-game.

Works for all mods published on GameBanana that contain an everest.yaml file (that is, those which offer the 1-click install button).
